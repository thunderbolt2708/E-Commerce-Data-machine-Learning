# E-commerce Customer Sentiment Prediction

## Overview

This Kaggle project focuses on predicting customer sentiment in the context of E-commerce using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By analyzing customer sentiments, E-commerce businesses can gain insights into customer satisfaction levels and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](link_to_dataset) (provide the actual link). It consists of customer reviews along with their associated sentiment labels. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, allowing for model development, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and identify patterns or trends that might influence sentiment.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and transform the raw text data into a suitable format for training machine learning models.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the text data that can contribute to sentiment prediction, such as word embeddings, TF-IDF representations, or sentiment scores.

- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to find the best performing model for sentiment classification.

- **Model Training:** Train the selected model(s) using the training dataset and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
